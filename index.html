                    <p>Javier Banuelos was born May 14, 1986 in San Diego, California to his parents, Francisco and Susana Banuelos. On May 14th exactly two years later, his younger sister was born! The two not only shared a birthday, but also interests in anime, gaming, and general nerd-dom. Javier graduated from SDSU with a BSME, and married the love of his life Narayani Peesapati-Banuelos in 2013. The two have two boys together, Suryamitra (Age 3) and Phalachandra (Age 6 months).</p>
                    <p>Javier has worked as a successful Applications/Sales Engineer for the Industrial Automation industry for over 6 years. His adaptability in the workplace and eagerness to adopt new technologies has often led to programs that increase workplace efficiency and increase the effictiveness of his company's ability to provide customer service. However, he soon realized his passion was not in what he was currently doing.</p>
                    <p>Constantly finding himself watching coding videos, Javier constantly dreamed about a life as a software developer. More specifically his passion for games kept his mind gravitating to wanting to be a game dev/designer. It took some time, but now he is purusing his dream of learning to code and is all to excited to see where this new path takes him!</p>
